# CSS-Training
In this page i learn basic of css
for my first commit there are two things happening
using Alvin method we use the combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
for css roughly using class as selector and javascript using id as selector.
mostly things happen in javascript are using DOM as tool.

Using Rakhmat method we learn the basic usage of css
mostly about display,position, and box handling
